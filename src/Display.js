// ### Count Rules

// - balls and strikes reset to 0 when a player reaches 3 strikes or 4 balls.
// - balls and strikes reset to 0 when a `hit` is recorded.
// - a `foul` increases strikes up to 2. With no strikes, a foul makes it 1 strike. With 1 strike, a foul makes it 2 strikes. With two strikes a foul has no effect, count stays at 2 strikes.
